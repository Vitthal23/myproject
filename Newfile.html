    <!-- <p>The online encyclopedia project, Wikipedia, is the most popular wiki-based website, and is one of the most widely viewed sites in the world, having been ranked in the top twenty since 2007.[3] Wikipedia is not a single wiki but rather a collection of hundreds of wikis, with each one pertaining to a specific language.</p> -->

        <b>Wikis</b>  have <i>favored</i> plain-text editing, with <br><hr> fewer and simpler <u>conventions than HTML for</u> indicating style and Although limiting access to HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) of wikis limits user ability to alter the structure  <br><hr> and formatting of wiki content, there are some benefits. Limited access to CSS promotes consistency in the look and feel, and having JavaScript disabled prevents a user from implementing code that may limit other users' access.
